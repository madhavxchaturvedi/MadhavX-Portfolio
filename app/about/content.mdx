I'm a software developer with a keen focus on creating beautiful and intuitive user interfaces.
I specialize in React.js, Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind to build scalable and efficient web applications.

I bring extensive experience in web development, having worked with companies like [Code and Theory](https://www.codeandtheory.com/), [Cell 5](https://www.cell5.co.uk/), and [Create](https://www.create.xyz/).
Now I am a Software Developer at [Aphex](https://aphex.co/), where we are building the future of construction software planning.
