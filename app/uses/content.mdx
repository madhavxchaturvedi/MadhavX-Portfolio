## Editor

- My editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), a versatile and reliable editor I use daily.
- I am currently using [Tokyo Night](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=enkia.tokyo-night) as my theme

## Terminal

- I use [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) when I'm on Ubuntu or macOS  
- [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal/9n0dx20hk701) when I'm on Windows. It's running [oh-my-zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/) stock

## Desktop Apps

- [Brave](https://brave.com/) is my main browser for both browsing and development  
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) for API development and testing  
- [Slack](https://slack.com/) and [Discord](https://discord.com/) for messaging or calls

- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/ph-en/) for music

## Frontend Development

- I use **JavaScript (ES6+)** as my primary language for frontend logic and often refer to the [MDN JavaScript docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) for reference.  
- For building dynamic UIs, I work with [React.js](https://react.dev/), creating reusable components.  
- When I need server-side rendering or static site generation, I use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs).  
- For managing state predictably in large apps, I use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/).  
- I write semantic and accessible markup with [HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML).  
- For styling and layouts, I use [CSS3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS), including Flexbox and Grid.  
- For rapid, utility-first styling, I rely on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs).  
- For smooth animations and transitions, I use [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).  
- I also use [EJS](https://ejs.co/) as a simple templating language that allows me to generate HTML with plain JavaScript.  
- And for responsive, mobile-first UI components, I use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Backend Development

- For backend development, I run JavaScript on [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).  
- I build lightweight backend APIs with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/).  
- I store flexible, schema-less data in [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/).  
- When structured relational data is needed, I use [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/).  
- For authentication, hosting, and real-time databases, I often use [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs).

## Development & Deployment Tools

- I track code changes using [Git](https://git-scm.com/doc).  
- For code hosting and collaboration, I use [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/) and sometimes [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/), which also helps with CI/CD pipelines.  
- For deploying modern web apps serverlessly, I use [Vercel](https://vercel.com/docs).  
- For static site hosting and automation, I prefer [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/).  
- For hosting full-stack apps on the cloud, I rely on [Render](https://render.com/docs).

## Testing & Quality

- I write tests using the [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/getting-started) JavaScript testing framework.  
- To keep my code clean and consistent, I run [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/) for linting.  
- I automatically format code with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/docs/en/).
